# My C++ and DSA Learning Journey

## Day 1: Introduction to Pseudocode and Flowcharts
- **Topics Covered**: Pseudocode, Flowcharts
- **Description**: We started with the basics of problem-solving using pseudocode and flowcharts. This day was focused on understanding the logic and planning of algorithms without diving into actual coding.

## Day 2: Basics of C++
- **Topics Covered**: Variables, Data Types, Comments, Type Conversion, Type Casting, Operators
- **Description**: We explored fundamental concepts of C++ programming. This included learning about different types of variables and data types, how to use comments, and the concepts of type conversion and casting. Operators were also covered.

## Day 3: Conditionals and Loops
- **Topics Covered**: Conditionals (if, else if, else, ternary), Loops (while, for, do-while)
- **Description**: The focus was on control flow mechanisms in C++. We learned how to use various conditionals and loops to control the flow of our programs.

## Day 4: Patterns
- **Topics Covered**: Pattern Printing
- **Description**: We practiced generating and printing various patterns using loops. This exercise helped in understanding nested loops and their applications.

---
## Day 5: Functions
- **Topics Covered**: Function Definition and Declaration, Parameters and Arguments, Functions in memory and pass by value.
- **Description**: We covered essential concepts of functions in C++. Topics included function definitions, declarations, prototypes, overloading, parameters, return types, and the scope and lifetime of variables.

## Day 6: Binary Number Systems
- **Topics Covered**: Binary Number Systems, binary to decimal, decimal to binary, 1s complement, 2s complement.
- **Description**: We explored binary number systems, the code for the conversion of decimal to binary and binary to decimal.

## Day 7: Bitwise Opearators, scope of a variable and data type modifiers
- **Topics Covered**: Bitwise Operators, Variable Scope, Data Type Modifiers.
- **Description**: We explored bitwise operators in C++, including their use and how they operate on binary representations of data. The session also covered the scope of variables, explaining how variable visibility and lifetime are affected by their scope. Additionally, we discussed data type modifiers such as signed, unsigned, short, and long, and how they alter the range and storage of data types.

## Day 8: Introduction to Arrays, Array Operations, and Function Parameter Passing by Reference
- **Topics Covered**: Arrays, Array Operations with Loops, Pass-by-Reference, Linear Search, Reverse Array.
- **Description**: On Day 8, we delved into the fundamental concept of arrays in C++. We began with the basics of arrays, including their declaration, initialization, and accessing elements. We then explored how to perform operations on arrays using loops, which included iterating through elements and modifying array content.

We also examined function parameter passing by reference, discussing how passing arrays to functions allows for efficient data manipulation without the overhead of copying.

The session covered linear search algorithms for finding elements within an array and demonstrated how to reverse an array in-place using loops. Through these topics, we gained a comprehensive understanding of array operations and function interactions in C++.

## Day 9: Advanced Array Concepts and STL: Vectors and Memory Management
- **Topics Covered**: Standard Template Library (STL), Vectors, For-Each Loops, Vector Functions, Vector Syntax, Static vs Dynamic Memory Allocation, Vector Memory Layout, LeetCode Problem.
- **Description**:  On Day 9, we expanded our understanding of array management in C++ by exploring the Standard Template Library (STL) with a focus on vectors. We learned about vector syntax, various functions provided by the vector class, and how to efficiently use the for-each loop for iteration. We also covered crucial concepts related to memory management, including static versus dynamic memory allocation and how vectors are managed in memory. To consolidate our learning, we solved a practical problem from LeetCode(single number question), applying our knowledge of vectors .

## Current Status
I have recently embarked on my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey. The topics covered so far have laid a solid foundation in C++ programming, and I am excited to delve deeper into more complex concepts and problems.

Feel free to check back for updates as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in C++ and DSA!
