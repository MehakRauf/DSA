# My C++ and DSA Learning Journey

## Day 1: Introduction to Pseudocode and Flowcharts
- **Topics Covered**: Pseudocode, Flowcharts
- **Description**: We started with the basics of problem-solving using pseudocode and flowcharts. This day was focused on understanding the logic and planning of algorithms without diving into actual coding.

## Day 2: Basics of C++
- **Topics Covered**: Variables, Data Types, Comments, Type Conversion, Type Casting, Operators
- **Description**: We explored fundamental concepts of C++ programming. This included learning about different types of variables and data types, how to use comments, and the concepts of type conversion and casting. Operators were also covered.

## Day 3: Conditionals and Loops
- **Topics Covered**: Conditionals (if, else if, else, ternary), Loops (while, for, do-while)
- **Description**: The focus was on control flow mechanisms in C++. We learned how to use various conditionals and loops to control the flow of our programs.

## Day 4: Patterns
- **Topics Covered**: Pattern Printing
- **Description**: We practiced generating and printing various patterns using loops. This exercise helped in understanding nested loops and their applications.

---
## Day 5: Functions
- **Topics Covered**: Function Definition and Declaration, Parameters and Arguments, Functions in memory and pass by value.
- **Description**: We covered essential concepts of functions in C++. Topics included function definitions, declarations, prototypes, overloading, parameters, return types, and the scope and lifetime of variables.

## Day 6: Bitwise Opearators, scope of a variable and data type modifiers
- **Topics Covered**: Bitwise Operators, Variable Scope, Data Type Modifiers.
- **Description**: We explored bitwise operators in C++, including their use and how they operate on binary representations of data. The session also covered the scope of variables, explaining how variable visibility and lifetime are affected by their scope. Additionally, we discussed data type modifiers such as signed, unsigned, short, and long, and how they alter the range and storage of data types.

## Current Status
I have recently embarked on my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey. The topics covered so far have laid a solid foundation in C++ programming, and I am excited to delve deeper into more complex concepts and problems.

Feel free to check back for updates as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in C++ and DSA!
